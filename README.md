#### Description:

Elemental Clash is a Python program created by Shine Wathan. It's a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the player competes against AI. The program allows the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then randomly generates the computer's choice. The game includes a twist: if the player wins, they are prompted to give a command to the AI. However, if the computer wins, it issues a command to the player instead. These commands involve typing a specific phrase multiple times as a form of "punishment" for losing. Additionally, the program attempts to incorporate sound effects for winning and losing, although this functionality is commented out due to issues with the pygame library, as noted in the comments. Overall, Elemental Clash provides a fun and interactive experience of the classic game with added elements of creativity and challenge.

#### Features:

* The game ends if a player has won.
* Draw if the player's input is equal to AI's choose.
* When I typed the sentence asked by ai, every time I finished typing, it show how many sentence I had already typed and how many were still to be typed.
* After typing as much as asked, it will show completion.
* If player type wrong, AI'll scold the player.

#### How to use (Guide):

* Player must input one of the rock paper scissors.
* If you want to rematch, you can type "yes" or "no" after the game.
